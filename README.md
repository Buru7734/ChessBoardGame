## Why chess:

I played chess a lot when I was a child. My dad taught me the game, and I often played with my godfather as well. I also played frequently with my grandmother, which became a very special way to connect with her. I know that chess was the ultimate reason I became her favorite grandchild. That’s why I chose chess.

## Basics:

Chess is a two-player strategy game played on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares. Each player controls 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, and 8 pawns. The objective is to checkmate your opponent’s king, which means putting the king in a position where it cannot escape capture.

## Basic Setup:

Each player has two rows of pieces.
Back row (closest to the player): Rooks in the corners, knights next to rooks, bishops next, then the queen (on her own color), and the king on the remaining square.
Front row: All pawns.

## How the Pieces Move:

- **King** – Moves 1 square in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
  Queen – Moves any number of squares in any direction.

- **Rook** – Moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically.

- **Bishop** – Moves any number of squares diagonally.

- **Knight** – Moves in an L-shape: 2 squares in one direction and then 1 square perpendicular. Knights can jump over other pieces.

- **Pawn** – Moves forward 1 square, but captures diagonally. On its first move, a pawn can move 2 squares forward.

## Special Moves:

- _Castling_ – King moves 2 squares toward a rook, and the rook jumps over the king. Only if neither has moved, no pieces are in between, and the king is not in check.

- _En passant_ – A special pawn capture if an opponent’s pawn moves 2 squares forward from its starting position and lands next to your pawn.
- _Promotion_ – When a pawn reaches the far end of the board, it can become any other piece (usually a queen).

## Game End:

Check – King is under threat of capture; the player must move the king or block/capture the threatening piece.
Checkmate – King is in check and cannot escape. The game ends, and the player delivering checkmate wins.
Draw – The game can end in a draw by stalemate (no legal moves), insufficient material, threefold repetition, or the 50-move rule.Chess is a two-player strategy game played on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares.

## Technologies used:

JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

## Next steps:

I still need to implement the queen’s movements, castling, Promotion and the en passant capture. In addition, I want to add a “lights out” mode and improve the CSS styling, with a strong focus on making the design responsive across different devices using media queries.
